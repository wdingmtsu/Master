The codes associated with each project we finished from SIMIODE (https://www.simiode.org/)

The following codes associated with 

1. M & M Disease Modeling Project (Brian Winkel (2015), "1-017-T-DiseaseSpread," https://www.simiode.org/resources/700.) 

2. Ebola Modeling: (Jonathan Paynter; Patrick Mugg; Lamar Adams (2016), "6-015-S-CombatingEbolaEpidemic," https://simiode.org/resources/1551.)

The codes are:

- 1(a) Bisection and Newton's Methods to do parameter estimation for the growth rate: --- BiNew_RF.py.

- 1(b) Simunated Annealing Method to do parameter estimation for the growth rate: --- growth_rate_R_Parameter_Estimation.py.

- 1(c) Codes to generate the disease spread grid without implementing the experiment using M&Ms: --- Sim.py.

- 2(a) Ebola with sliders to interact with the model to see how the change in the parameters affect the behavior of susceptible, exposed, infected and recovered populations: --- Ebola.ipynb
