The codes associated with each project we finished from SIMIODE (https://www.simiode.org/)

The following codes associated with M & M Disease Modeling Project from SIMIODE (Brian Winkel (2015), "1-017-T-DiseaseSpread," https://www.simiode.org/resources/700.). 

The codes are:

- Bisection and Newton's Methods to do parameter estimation for the growth rate r: BiNew_RF.py.

- Simunated Annealing Method to do parameter estimation for the growth rate r: growth_rate_R_Parameter_Estimation.py.

- Codes to generate the disease spread grid without implementing the experiment using M&Ms: Sim.py.
