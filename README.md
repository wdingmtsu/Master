The codes associated with each project we finished from SIMIODE (https://www.simiode.org/) written by Ryan Florida, Jeffery Summers, Ben Burton and Puran Nepal.

The following codes associated with 

1. M & M Disease Modeling Project (Brian Winkel (2015), "1-017-T-DiseaseSpread," https://www.simiode.org/resources/700.) 

2. Ebola Modeling: (Jonathan Paynter; Patrick Mugg; Lamar Adams (2016), "6-015-S-CombatingEbolaEpidemic," https://simiode.org/resources/1551.)

3. Malaria Control: (David Culver (2016), "1-024-S-MalariaControl," https://simiode.org/resources/1750.)

4. Pendulum Modeling: Brian Winkel (2016), "3-080-S-PendulumModeling," https://simiode.org/resources/2643.

The codes are:

- 1(a) Bisection and Newton's Methods to do parameter estimation for the growth rate: --- BiNew_RF.ipynb.

- 1(b) Simunated Annealing Method to do parameter estimation for the growth rate: --- growth_rate_R_Parameter_Estimation.ipynb.

- 1(c) Codes to generate the disease spread grid without implementing the experiment using M&Ms: --- Sim.py.

- 2(a) Ebola Modeling with sliders to see how the changes in the parameters affect the dynamics of susceptible, exposed, infected and recovered populations: --- Ebola.ipynb

- 3 Malaria Control:  modelling concentration of two particular drugs, Proguanil and Atovaquone, in the blood stream during a given number of days. --- Malaria-Control.ipynb

- 4 Pendulum Modeling: ideal pendulum and dampled pendulum. --- PendulumWithOutResistence.ipynb, ResistancePendulum1.ipynb and ResistancePendulum2.ipynb
